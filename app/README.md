# Adding `lbfmodel.yaml`

To ensure the application works correctly, you need to add the `lbfmodel.yaml` file to the appropriate directory. This file is required for facial landmark detection.

## Steps to Add `lbfmodel.yaml`

1. Obtain the `lbfmodel.yaml` file. You can download it from the official OpenCV GitHub repository or other trusted sources.
2. Place the `lbfmodel.yaml` file in the root directory of the project, specifically in the `app` folder.
3. Verify that the file is correctly located by checking the path `app/lbfmodel.yaml`.
